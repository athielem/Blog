										<h6><span class="date">22 August 2021</span>
                                        <p>As reported on August 22nd, 2021 in the news article <a href="https://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2021-08/bundestagswahl-umfrage-spd-union-laschet-scholz">'SPD holt Union in Umfrage ein'</a> of <i>ZEIT ONLINE</i>, the weekly opinion poll conducted by Insa (a pollster) for the newspaper <i> Bild am Sonntag </i> has found that both candidates of the CDU and the SPD, Armin Laschet and Olaf Scholz respectively, are currently tying at 22% of participants' willingness to vote for a candidate in the upcoming elections of the Bundestag on September 26th, 2021. It is hence becoming more likely that the CDU's (as CDU and the so-called 'sister party' CSU form a political alliance, the same applies for the latter) reign of appointing the German chancellor after sixteen years of Angela Merkel in office may be coming to an end.</p>
                                        <p>This is remarkable because not so long ago the SPD's outlook of performing well in the upcoming elections was deemed to be rather grim, in contrast to the CDU and the Greens. Mishaps of both parties' candidates, Armin Laschet and Annalena Baerbock, however seem to have contributed towards changing the momentum for the benefit of the SPD (while Laschet was caught grinning at an emergency press conference held in Erftstadt which was devastated by the high floodings in the beginning of July 2021, Baerbock has been facing several claims of plagiarism).</p>
										<p>With roughly a month left till the elections and with chances of Laschet achieving a U-turn in popularity considered to be somewhat low, some political spectators have weighed in by proposing to ditch the current candidate for the leader of the CSU, Markus Söder, who came in second in the previous political contest between CDU and CSU for providing the chancellor candidate for the Christian-democratic alliance (yes, the irony). The important question that remains is: could this decision end up wreaking havoc on the political outlook of both the CDU and the CSU, by giving voters the impression of chaotic and quarrelling political factions that seem to be incapable of uniting to find the answers for the pressing problems of today, such as climate change?</p>
										<p>I personally believe that the odds where Laschet is capable of generating stellar political moments in the few weeks left (which seem to be needed for convincingly winning the election) that portray him as a fully-capable, persuasive and competent chancellor are decreasing by the day; this is further exacerbated by comments from CDU politicians that are reminiscent of morale-boosting talk rather than a clearly-sketched game plan. In light of this situation, and furthermore considering that Söder previously was attaining the top spot as the most promising chancellor candidate in election surveys, it seems sensible to take the calculated risk of substituting in a last-minute call the current candidate Laschet. However, nothing would be gained if the political parties did not show clear signs of consolidation afterwards. As the trite adage goes 'Everyone makes mistakes.'; as long as you learn from them. If internal conflicts were to resume, the potentially positive effect of this decision would likely evaporate. Therefore, whether Söder can indeed turn the tide in favor of the Christian-democrats seems to hinge explicitly on the agreeableness and sense of cooperation that both political divisions are willing to bring to the table.</p>
