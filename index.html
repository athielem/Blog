                            <h3><a href="#">Carbon capture at the 'end of the tunnel'?</a></h3>
                            <h6><span class="date">18 September 2021</span>
                            <p>In 'The world's biggest carbon-removal plant switches on' of The Economist, published on September 18th, 2021 in the section Science & Technology, the authors provide a short summary of the bringing into service of Orca - according to the company climeworks, the 'world’s first and largest climate-positive direct air capture and storage plant' - on September 8th, 2021 in Iceland, which seems to have been making the headlines on several major international news outlets.</p>
                            <p>The heightened interest for new technologies that can contribute towards fighting climate change should come as no surprise to many readers, as the perceived number of negative events related to global warming seems to have been picking up pace as of late: From the extreme heatwave that struck the Pacific coast of the U.S. and Canada by the end of June 2021 (one of the consequences being that reportedly more than a billion marine wildlife animals have found their death due to highly elevated water temperatures), to the severe flooding taking place in Germany in the midst of July 2021, and the latest installment of the report of the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), summarizing the current scientific status quo on the causes, determinants and consequences of anthropocentric climate change (which was overarchingly interpreted as an alarming call for everyone, but particularly international leaders who hold considerably sway over possibilities to propose and implement environmental regulations, to substantially increase our efforts to reduce CO2 emissions), they all have greatly contributed to illustrating that despite the blurry character of human activities detrimentally impacting our environment as the question of accountability and ramifications regarding negative externalities is inherently difficult to pinpoint (how exactly to attribute CO2 to the specific action that has purportedly emitted it and how precisely is it impacting our ecosystem), due to the accumulating nature of CO2 the (likely) link between cause and effect of man-made climate change is becoming every day more visible. Which is good news.</p>
                            <p>So how does Orca work? In a nutshell, according to the IEA (International Energy Agency) it is a 'direct air capture' technology that is capable of filtering out CO2 from the air and storing it underground. As this renders a permanent removal of greenhouse gas from the atmosphere, it belongs to the class of technologies that yield negative emissions. This should not be mistaken with other technological alternatives such as CCU (carbon capture and utilization), whose main objective does not lie in merely absorbing CO2 that arises for instance in part of a company's supply chain but likewise reusing it at a later stage; despite it not qualifying as negative emissions, there are other associated benefits such as better carbon footprint as the firm's CO2 emissions overall decrease. A very similar approach denominated CCS (carbon capture and storage) matches the CCU's first stage of absorbing CO2, however does not seek to reutilize but rather neutralize its otherwise negative impact on the environment by 'tucking it away' from the eye of the public in the second stage (though this does seem probable to potentially cause a wide array of other problems if pursued at a higher scale). And for every tonne of CO2 emissions plucked from the air, the company accordingly sells certificates to companies seeking to ameliorate their carbon footprint.</p>										
                            <p>So does Orca constitute a turning point in tackling climate change? Well, it depends. If we take the operating site alone into consideration, hardly. This is due to two reasons: For one, it is estimated to retrieve 4,000 tonnes of CO2 every year, which is roughly 0.00000286% of total CO2 emissions (given that the number is estimated to be 35bn tonnes). If my numbers are correct, we would have to set up about 350,000 Orcas on our planet to reduce annual CO2 emissions by 1%. That seems like a tall order (or does it?). For the other, which may not be so surprising at this early technological stage, the costs for a tonne of CO2 sequestered are $600-800 (the company claims that economies of scale could allow it to diminish its costs by a factor of ten in the future, however this would remain to be seen). While demand at this price for CO2 certificates is going strong (according to The Economist), it does seem likely that for the time being rather large corporations are engaging with this offering rather than smaller ones (as both turnover and profits are on average larger for big companies than for small companies due to sheer scale and hence marginal costs for a given volume of CO2 are lower). Consequently, if prices were in contrast to expectation to remain rather stable in time, this would not bode well for our continuing efforts to halt global warming as a considerable chunk of companies would de facto be excluded from engaging with this particular kind of CO2-reducing technology.</p>
                            <p>However, I do believe that what Orca is indeed bringing to the table is providing a very powerful signal that both the science and the engineering disciplines in charge of the technical and economical transition (one question is to being able to produce something, quite another one is whether it can be done so cost-effectively) have reached a point where technologies that metaphorically-speaking are 'swifting through the air with their bare hands to catch particles of CO2 from the air and setting us free from the burden of a warming planet' are no longer merely science fiction, but becoming a reality. While the economics of negative emission technologies at this point are still looking rather grim (it seems likely that a similar statement could be made regarding other similar technologies, such as CCU/CCS), it could however greatly contribute to the momentum of increasing collective efforts, therefore improving the existing incentives structure and hence making it more likely that bringing global warming to a standstill does not turn into a Fata Morgana. Fingers crossed.</p>

                            <h3><a href="#">The SPD strikes back?</a></h3>
                            <h6><span class="date">22 August 2021</span>
                            <p>As reported on August 22nd, 2021 in the news article <a href="https://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2021-08/bundestagswahl-umfrage-spd-union-laschet-scholz">'SPD holt Union in Umfrage ein'</a> of <i>ZEIT ONLINE</i>, the weekly opinion poll conducted by Insa (a pollster) for the newspaper <i> Bild am Sonntag </i> has found that both candidates of the CDU and the SPD, Armin Laschet and Olaf Scholz respectively, are currently tying at 22% of participants' willingness to vote for a candidate in the upcoming elections of the Bundestag on September 26th, 2021. It is hence becoming more likely that the CDU's (as CDU and the so-called 'sister party' CSU form a political alliance, the same applies for the latter) reign of appointing the German chancellor after sixteen years of Angela Merkel in office may be coming to an end.</p>
                            <p>This is remarkable because not so long ago the SPD's outlook of performing well in the upcoming elections was deemed to be rather grim, in contrast to the CDU and the Greens. Mishaps of both parties' candidates, Armin Laschet and Annalena Baerbock, however seem to have contributed towards changing the momentum for the benefit of the SPD (while Laschet was caught grinning at an emergency press conference held in Erftstadt which was devastated by the high floodings in the beginning of July 2021, Baerbock has been facing several claims of plagiarism).</p>
                            <p>With roughly a month left till the elections and with chances of Laschet achieving a U-turn in popularity considered to be somewhat low, some political spectators have weighed in by proposing to ditch the current candidate for the leader of the CSU, Markus Söder, who came in second in the previous political contest between CDU and CSU for providing the chancellor candidate for the Christian-democratic alliance (yes, the irony). The important question that remains is: could this decision end up wreaking havoc on the political outlook of both the CDU and the CSU, by giving voters the impression of chaotic and quarrelling political factions that seem to be incapable of uniting to find the answers for the pressing problems of today, such as climate change?</p>
                            <p>I personally believe that the odds where Laschet is capable of generating stellar political moments in the few weeks left (which seem to be needed for convincingly winning the election) that portray him as a fully-capable, persuasive and competent chancellor are decreasing by the day; this is further exacerbated by comments from CDU politicians that are reminiscent of morale-boosting talk rather than a clearly-sketched game plan. In light of this situation, and furthermore considering that Söder previously was attaining the top spot as the most promising chancellor candidate in election surveys, it seems sensible to take the calculated risk of substituting in a last-minute call the current candidate Laschet. However, nothing would be gained if the political parties did not show clear signs of consolidation afterwards. As the trite adage goes 'Everyone makes mistakes.'; as long as you learn from them. If internal conflicts were to resume, the potentially positive effect of this decision would likely evaporate. Therefore, whether Söder can indeed turn the tide in favor of the Christian-democrats seems to hinge explicitly on the agreeableness and sense of cooperation that both political divisions are willing to bring to the table.</p>
